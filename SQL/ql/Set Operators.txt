5. You are given the following query.

SELECT country, region, city
FROM HR.Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT country, region, city
FROM Production.Suppliers;

You are asked to add logic to the query so that it guarantees that the rows from Employees are
returned in the output before the rows from Suppliers. Also, within each segment, the rows should be
sorted by country, region, and city.

Tables involved: HR.Employees and Production.Suppliers
Output: country, region, city
